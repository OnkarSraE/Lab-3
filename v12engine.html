    <p>Balance and smoothness
        Each bank of a V12 engine essentially functions as a straight-six engine, which by itself has perfect primary
        and secondary engine balance. A four-stroke V12 engine has even firing order at V-angles of 60, 120, or 180
        degrees[1] Many V12 engines use a V-angle of 60 degrees between the two banks of cylinders.[2] V12 engines with
        other V-angles have been produced, sometimes using split crankpins to reduce the unbalanced vibrations. The
        drawbacks of V12 engines include extra cost, complexity, friction losses, and external size and weight, compared
        with engines containing fewer cylinders.

        At any given time, three of the cylinders in a V12 engine are in their power stroke, which increases the
        smoothness of the power delivery by eliminating gaps between power pulses.

        A V12 engine with a 180 degree V-angle is often called a flat-twelve engine. These are also sometimes called
        'boxer twelve' engines, however this terminology is incorrect for the majority of 180-degree V12 engines, since
        they use shared crankpins and are therefore not configured as boxer engines.[3]

        Theoretically, the rotating parts of a V12 racing engine could be lighter than a crossplane V8 engine of similar
        displacement due to the V12 engine not requiring counterweights on the crankshaft or as much inertial mass for
        the flywheel. In addition, the exhaust system of a V12 engine is much simpler than would be required for a
        crossplane V8 engine to achieve pulsed exhaust gas tuning. However, the use of V12 engines in motor racing is
        uncommon in the 21st century.</p>
