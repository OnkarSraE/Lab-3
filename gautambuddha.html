    <p>Siddhartha Gautama,[e] most commonly referred to as the Buddha ('the awakened'),[f][g] was a wandering ascetic
        and religious teacher who lived in the Indian subcontinent or South Asia (the Himalayan foothils of present-day
        Nepal and the eastern Ganges plain of northern India), during the 6th or 5th century BCE[4][5][6][c] and founded
        Buddhism. According to Buddhist legends, he was born in Lumbini, in what is now Nepal,[b] to royal parents of
        the Shakya clan, but renounced his home life to live as a wandering ascetic.[7][h] After leading a life of
        mendicancy, asceticism, and meditation, he attained nirvana at Bodh Gaya in what is now India. The Buddha then
        wandered through the lower Indo-Gangetic Plain, teaching and building a monastic order. Buddhist tradition holds
        he died in Kushinagar and reached parinirvana ("final release from conditioned existence"[8]).[i]

        According to Buddhist tradition, the Buddha taught a Middle Way between sensual indulgence and severe
        asceticism,[9] leading to freedom from ignorance, craving, rebirth, and suffering. His core teachings are
        summarized in the Four Noble Truths and the Noble Eightfold Path, a training of the mind that includes ethical
        training and kindness toward others, and meditative practices such as sense restraint, mindfulness, dhyana
        (meditation proper). Another key element of his teachings are the concepts of the five skandhas and dependent
        origination, describing how all dharmas (both mental states and concrete 'things') come into being, and cease to
        be, depending on other dharmas, lacking an existence on their own svabhava.</p>
