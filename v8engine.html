    <p>V-angle

        1917 Liberty L-8— an aircraft engine with a V-angle of 45°
        Most engines use a V-angle (the angle between the two banks of cylinders) of 90 degrees. This angle results in
        good engine balance, which results in low vibrations.[5] However, the downside is the greater width of the
        engine compared to those that use a smaller V-angle.

        V8 engines with a 60-degree V-angle were used in the 1996–1999 Ford Taurus SHO, the 2005–2011 Volvo XC90, and
        the 2006–2009 Volvo S80. The Ford engine used a 60-degree V-angle because it was based on a V6 engine with a
        60-degree V-angle. Both the Ford and Volvo engines were used in transverse engine chassis, which were designed
        for a front-wheel-drive layout (with an on-demand all-wheel drive system in the case of the Volvos). To reduce
        the vibrations caused by the unbalanced 60-degree V-angle, the Volvo engines used a balance shaft and offset
        split crankpins.[6] The Rolls-Royce Meteorite tank engine also used a 60-degree V-angle, since it was derived
        from the 60 degree V12 Rolls-Royce Meteor which in turn was based on the Rolls-Royce Merlin V12 engine.[7]

        Other V-angles have been used occasionally. The Lancia Trikappa, Lancia Dilambda, and Lancia Astura, produced
        1922–1939, used narrow angle V8 engines (based on the Lancia V4 engine) with V-angles of 14–24 degrees.[8] The
        1932 Miller four-wheel drive racing cars used a V8 engine with a V-angle of 45 degrees.[9] The 8-cylinder
        versions of the 1945 through 1966 EMD 567 diesel locomotive engine also used a V-angle of 45 degrees.</p>
