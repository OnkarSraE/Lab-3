    <p>Born into an aristocratic Bengali Kayastha family in Calcutta, Vivekananda was inclined from a young age towards
        religion and spirituality. He later found his guru Ramakrishna and became a monk. After the death of
        Ramakrishna, Vivekananda extensively toured the Indian subcontinent as a wandering monk and acquired first-hand
        knowledge of the living conditions of Indian people in then British India. Moved by their plight, he resolved to
        help them and found a way to travel to the United States, where he became a popular figure after the 1893
        Parliament of Religions in Chicago at which he delivered his famous speech beginning with the words: "Sisters
        and brothers of America ..." while introducing Hinduism to Americans.[10][11] He made such an impression there
        that an American newspaper described him as "an orator by divine right and undoubtedly the greatest figure at
        the Parliament".[12]

        After great success at the Parliament, in the subsequent years, Vivekananda delivered hundreds of lectures
        across the United States, England, and Europe, disseminating the core tenets of Hindu philosophy, and founded
        the Vedanta Society of New York and the Vedanta Society of San Francisco (now Vedanta Society of Northern
        California),[13] both of which became the foundations for Vedanta Societies in the West. In India, he founded
        the Ramakrishna Math, which provides spiritual training for monastics and householders, and the Ramakrishna
        Mission, which provides charity, social work and education.</p>
