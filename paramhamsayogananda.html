    <p>Paramahansa Yogananda (born Mukunda Lal Ghosh; January 5, 1893  March 7, 1952) was an Indian-American Hindu
        monk, yogi and guru who introduced millions to meditation and Kriya Yoga through his organization,
        Self-Realization Fellowship (SRF) / Yogoda Satsanga Society (YSS) of India  the only one he created to
        disseminate his teachings. A chief disciple of the yoga guru Swami Sri Yukteswar Giri, he was sent by his
        lineage to spread the teachings of yoga to the West. He immigrated to the US at the age of 27[2] to prove the
        unity between Eastern and Western religions and to preach a balance between Western material growth and Indian
        spirituality.[3] His long-standing influence in the American yoga movement, and especially the yoga culture of
        Los Angeles, led him to be considered by yoga experts as the "Father of Yoga in the West". He lived his last 32
        years in the US.[4][5][6]

        Yogananda was the first major Indian teacher to settle in the US, and the first prominent Indian to be hosted in
        the White House (by President Calvin Coolidge in 1927);[7] his early acclaim led to him being dubbed "the 20th
        century's first superstar guru" by the Los Angeles Times.[8] Arriving in Boston in 1920, he embarked on a
        successful transcontinental speaking tour before settling in Los Angeles in 1925. For the next two and a half
        decades, he gained local fame and expanded his influence worldwide: he created a monastic order and trained
        disciples, went on teaching tours, bought properties for his organization in various California locales, and
        initiated thousands into Kriya Yoga.[5] By 1952, SRF had over 100 centers in both India and the United States.
        As of 2012, they had groups in nearly every major American city.[8] His "plain living and high thinking"
        principles attracted people from all backgrounds among his followers.[5]

        He published his Autobiography of a Yogi in 1946 to critical and commercial acclaim. It has sold over four
        million copies, with Harper San Francisco listing it as one of the "100 best spiritual books of the 20th
        Century".[9][8][10] Former Apple CEO Steve Jobs ordered 500 copies of the book, for each guest at his memorial
        to be given a copy.[11] It was also one of Elvis Presley's favorite books, and one he gave out often. The book
        has been regularly reprinted and is known as "the book that changed the lives of millions".[12][13] A
        documentary about his life commissioned by SRF, Awake: The Life of Yogananda, was released in 2014.[14] He
        remains a leading figure in Western spirituality. A biographer of Yogananda, Phillip Goldberg, considers him
        "the best known and most beloved of all Indian spiritual teachers who have come to the West".</p>
