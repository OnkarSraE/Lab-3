    <p>A V6 engine is a six-cylinder piston engine where the cylinders share a common crankshaft and are
        arranged in a V configuration. The first V6 engines were designed and produced independently by Marmon
        Motor Car Company, Deutz Gasmotoren Fabrik and Delahaye.
        Due to their short length, V6 engines are often used as the larger engine option for vehicles which are
        otherwise produced with inline-four engines, especially in transverse engine vehicles. A downside for luxury
        cars is that V6 engines produce more vibrations than straight-six engines. Some sports cars like the Porsche 911
        use flat-six engines instead of V6 engines, due to their near perfect primary engine balance and lower centre of
        gravity (which improves the handling).

        The displacement of modern V6 engines is typically between 2.5 to 4.0 L (153 to 244 cu in), though larger and
        smaller examples have been produced, such as the 1.8 L (110 cu in) Mazda V6 used in the 1991–1998 Mazda MX-3,[2]
        or the 1.6 L (98 cu in) Mitsubishi V6 engine used in the 1992–1998 Mirage/Lancer, while the largest gasoline V6
        built was the 7.8 L (476 cu in) GMC V6 used in the 1962 GMC C/K series 6500.</p>
